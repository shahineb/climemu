# ESM Emulation with diffusion models in JAX

This repository contains the implementation for the paper **"Score-based generative emulation of impact-relevant earth system model outputs"**. Codebase allows to run emulators of monthly averaged near-surface temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, windspeed for MPI-ESM1-2-LR, MIROC6, ACCESS-ESM1-5.


## Installation

Code tested on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12. GPU support is required for efficient usage. Install from PyPI:
```bash
pip install climemu
```

## Usage

```python
import climemu

# Instantiate emulator
emulator = climemu.build_emulator("MPI-ESM1-2-LR")

# Download pretrained weights and compile (~1min)
emulator.load()
emulator.compile(n_samples=5)   # Nb of samples generated at each function call

# Generate 5 samples for a given gmst and month
samples = emulator(gmst=2,       # GMST anomaly wrt piControl (Â°C)
                   month=3,      # Month index (1-12)
                   seed=0,       # Random seed
                   xarray=True)  # Return xr.Dataset
```

:warning: _Default model files for usage are trained on the full set of Tier I SSP simulations. To reproduce the paper results follow [instructions](docs/reproducepaper.md)_.
